Requirements: Python latest stable release, psutil 7.0

Solver program usage CLI command: python <path_to_solver.py> <path_to_cnf.cnf>

In order to change which solvers the tester program runs, preface the individual line of each solver it is desired to **not** run.
The data will be stored in a file called "results.csv" **which you must rename before rerunning the program in order to not lose the data in question.**
